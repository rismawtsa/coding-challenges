 * "In computing, End Of File (commonly abbreviated EOF) is a condition in a
 * computer operating system where no more data can be read from a data source."
 * â€” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-file)
 * 
 * The challenge here is to read n lines of input until you reach EOF, then
 * number and print all n lines of content.
 * Hint: Java's Scanner.hasNext() method is helpful for this problem.
